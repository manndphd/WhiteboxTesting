The
first
question
you
need
to
ask
is
whether
you
really
need
the
ID
to be
random
Sometime
sequential
IDs
are
good
enough
Now
if
you
do
need
it
to
be
random,
we
first
note
a
generated
sequence
of numbers
that
contain
no
duplicates
can
not
be
called
random
p
Now
that
we
get
that 
out 
of 
the
way
the
fastest
way
to do
this
is
to
have
a
Hashtable
or
HashMap
containing
all the
IDs already
generated
Whenever
a
new
ID
is
generated
check
it
against
the
hashtable
re-generate
if
the
ID
already
occurs
